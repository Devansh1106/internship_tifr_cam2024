The real world problems requires massive amount of data generation and needs compute power of more than a few computing units such as CPU/GPUs. The aim of this project is to tackle the issue of usage of distributed memory on multiple nodes and to use the computing power of CPUs present on more than a node in an multi-node environment for an adaptive high-order numerical simulation framework for hyperbolic conservation laws --- \href{https://www.example.com}{\ttfamily TrixiLW.jl}\\ \\ 
In order to extend {\ttfamily TrixiLW.jl} to support distributed memory parallelization --- Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation is used. MPI is an open source implementation for parallelization developed and maintained by \href{https://www.mpi-forum.org/}{MPI Forum}. Optimization of MPI code have also been performed in order to get good speed-up and higher efficiency as demonstrated by the results of scaling tests.
